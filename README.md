Monthly Mortgage Payment Calculator
This web app calculates the monthly mortgage payment for a fixed-rate mortgage loan. The user is able to enter the principal amount and yearly rate for the mortgage as a percentage/decimal. The user is able to select the length of the mortgage. All user input is validated.
P is the principal, r is the monthly rate as a decimal and n is the length of the mortgage in months (years multiplied by 12).
