                <h2>How Monthly Mortgage Calculators Work</h2>
                <p>
                    Mortgage calculators are automated tools that enable users to determine the financial implications of changes 
                    in one or more variables in a mortgage financing arrangement. Mortgage calculators are used by consumers to 
                    determine monthly repayments, and by mortgage providers to determine the financial suitability of a home loan 
                    applicant. Mortgage calculators are frequently on for-profit websites, though the Consumer Financial Protection 
                    Bureau has launched its own public mortgage calculator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The major variables in a mortgage calculation include loan principal, balance, periodic compound interest rate, 
                    number of payments per year, total number of payments and the regular payment amount. More complex calculators 
                    can take into account other costs associated with a mortgage, such as local and state taxes, and insurance.
